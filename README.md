Q1 :Why cant we rely on CPU execution time to measure algorithm effciency?
-Because CPU's power depents on many things like,if we are going to multiple job at the same time we use CPU s power
and CPU cant measure efficent.


Q2 :How many operations?
int sum = 0 ;
sum = sum +5 ;
-This code has a O(1) notation since every line has a 1 operation.

Q3 :
a-)O(n)
b-)O(n^2)
c-)O()
